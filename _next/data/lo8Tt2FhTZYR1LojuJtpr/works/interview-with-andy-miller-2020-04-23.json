Miller discusses the impact that the fire had upon the fungi of the Smoky Mountains and how the various species are recovering. He also elaborates on the role that fungi play in the forest, both in terms of nutrients in the soil and interacting with other organisms. Conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a representative quote from the interview: this was a black morel that we found in a severely burned area. And it came up and  bodies there. We'd never found it in the park before, ever, probably because no one's look for it after a fire, and it came up all over the place. And we went back again in 2018, a year later, and never found one fruiting body ever. So it was one of those that just fruited once after the fire and then it was done."]},"metadata":[{"label":{"en":["Date"]},"value":{"en":["2020-04-23"]}},{"label":{"en":["Format"]},"value":{"en":["motion pictures (visual works)"]}},{"label":{"en":["Extent"]},"value":{"en":["00:31:33"]}},{"label":{"en":["Subject"]},"value":{"en":["Mycology","Forest regeneration","Wildfires"]}},{"label":{"en":["Narrator Role"]},"value":{"en":["Fire and forestry experts"]}},{"label":{"en":["Place"]},"value":{"en":["Great Smoky Mountains National Park"]}},{"label":{"en":["Description"]},"value":{"en":["Interview with Andrew Miller, professor with the School of Integrative Biology at the University of Illinois.
